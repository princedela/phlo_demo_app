Setting up a free kubernetes cluster plan was challenging and out of fear of time running out of time, the project is being submitted now, but I am still looking to finish setting up a public URL. I was unsure if github pages would have been acceptable but at the time, it's too late to ask. I am still setting up an aks cluster and when that is done, I will still proceed to send the link if that is acceptable
